//Test room labels
Great Hall has an initial of 'A'
Chamber of Secrets has an initial of 'C'
..etc

//testBoardDimensions
Our board has 42 rows and 29 columns so we used assertEquals and getNumRow/Rol to check if that was accurate

//testFourDirections
RavenClaw dormitory cell(10,5) has door that opens left

//testNumberOfDoors
We have 20 doors in our layout so we compared the count of doors to 20

//testRooms
Cell (23,23) is in great hall which is a room so we checked if room was not null
Cell (2,19) is a label cell so we used the isLabel() function to return true
Cell (3,0) is a secret passage so we checked if the isSecretPassage() function returns 0 (will change later to different return value)
